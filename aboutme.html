                <h2>Family</h2>
                <p>
                    I am the youngest of 5 boys in my family, and I love them all! My parents have been one of the greatest supports in my life.
                    I have many different hobbies that I enjoy doing in my spare time.
                </p>  
                <h2>Gaming</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy playing video games with my friends! I own a PC and a Nintendo Switch.
                    Some of the games I enjoy playing are Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart, Mario Party, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, Valorant, Apex Legends, PC Building Simulator, Farming Simulator, and many others!
                    I also like to dabble into emulation, using ones like Dolphin, Cemu, VirtualBoy, and some others too!
                </p>
                <h2>Technology</h2>
                <p>
                    I have always loved computers since I was little. In fact, I used to watch my dad work when I was a baby. My family always says that me doing that sparked my love for technology. 
                    I enjoy working on computers, whether it be building them, fixing them, helping with software, playing with my Arduino or Raspberry Pi 3. 
                    I enjoy taking things apart too! Iâ€™ve taken apart my laptop, PC, Switch, and various amounts of small technology as well. 
                </p>
